    "The general applications of decision tree: a decision tree can be used to visually and explicitly represent decisions and decision making. In data mining, a decision tree describes data but not decisions; rather the resulting classification tree can be an input for decision making. \n",
    "\n",
    "The general applications of support vector machine: SVMs can be used to solve various real world problems: SVMs are helpful in text and hypertext categorization as their application can significantly reduce the need for labeled training instances in both the standard inductive and transductive settings; SVMs are also useful in medical science to classify proteins with up to 90% of the compounds classified correctly; Hand-written characters can be recognized using SVM.\n",
    "\n",
    "The general applications of naive bayes: a popular method for text categorization, the problem of judging documents as belonging to one category or the other (such as spam or legitimate, sports or politics, etc.) with word frequencies as the features. It also finds application in automatic medical diagnosis.\n",
    "\n",
    "The strengths of Naive Bayes: It proves to be quite robust to irrelevant features, which it kindly ignores. It learns fast and predicts equally so. It does not require lots of storage. \n",
    "\n",
    "The weaknesses of Naive Bayes: In classification tasks you need a big data set in order to make reliable estimations of the probability of each class. You can use Naïve Bayes classification algorithm with a small data set but precision and recall will keep very low. \n",
    "\n",
    "The strengths of decision tree: Simple to understand and interpret; Requires little data preparation; Able to handle both numerical and categorical data; Possible to validate a model using statistical tests. That makes it possible to account for the reliability of the model; Performs well with large datasets. Large amounts of data can be analysed using standard computing resources in reasonable time.\n",
    "\n",
    "The weaknesses of decision tree: The problem of learning an optimal decision tree is known to be NP-complete under several aspects of optimality and even for simple concepts; Decision-tree learners can create over-complex trees that do not generalise well from the training data; There are concepts that are hard to learn because decision trees do not express them easily, such as XOR, parity or multiplexer problems. In such cases, the decision tree becomes prohibitively large.\n",
    "\n",
    "The strengths of Support vector machine:Since the kernel implicitly contains a non-linear transformation, no assumptions about the functional form of the transformation, which makes data linearly separable, is necessary. The transformation occurs implicitly on a robust theoretical basis and human expertise judgement beforehand is not needed; SVMs provide a good out-of-sample generalization, if the parameters C and r (in the case of a Gaussian kernel) are appropriately chosen. This means that, by choosing an appropriate generalization grade, SVMs can be robust, even when the training sample has some bias; \n",
    "\n",
    "The weaknesses of Support vector machine: lack of transparency of results.\"Perhaps the biggest limitation of the support vector approach lies in choice of the kernel.\"Burgess (1998)\"A second limitation is speed and size, both in training and testing.\"Burgess (1998).\n",
    "\n",
    "According to what I know about the data, because the output is a binary value -- not yes,then it is no, so it is a typical classification problem and the features in the data are almost categorical data type, so I think these three models could be chosen to be applied. "

In cases where the data is not linearly separable, a linear SVM may still be used when it allows for a certain amount of errors. This is achieved by introducing a slack variable ξ and an upper bound C for the number of errors. Intuitively, this works well because it allows for noise and is most tolerant to mistakes on either side.\n",
